## Installation

Make sure you have followed the instructions on the [backend](https://github.com/Worrad75/TAPioca-backend) repository. 

Navigate to the game's page with the following command: 

```bash
open index.html 
```

## Usage 
TAPioca is built using Rails, JS, HTML, and CSS. Users play the game by clicking on the bubbles and gaining points within the specified time frame. Clicks on the "bubbles" gain users one points and the final "ninja bubble" gains the user five points. Bubble sizes and speeds are generated randomly. 

## Future Expansion
TAPioca has the potential to add additional bubbles as well as various UI/UX developments. Users would ideally have the option to enter increasingly harder levels as well. 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
